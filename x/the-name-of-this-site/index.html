<p>Lenny Bruce had a bit – you can find it on Spotify as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/75imlloYHfvVoFnpTkzALs?si=7ec8d07f615545fc">The Steve Allen Show</a> (skip to 1:30) – where he talks about having a tattoo and how, as a Jew, he therefore couldn't be buried in a Jewish cemetery. His aunty berates him for it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Arrrgh! Arrrgh! Look vat you did! You ruined your arm! You can't be buried in a Jewish cemetery.&quot;
I said, &quot;Meema, what are you nudgin' me for? They'll cut this arm off, and they'll bury it in a Gentile cemetery.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was thinking of names for this site, I was thinking of comedians, and I thought have having something associated with Lenny Bruce because he's kind of the godfather of the comedy I like. For some reason that bit of his came to mind, and from there the phrase &quot;Gentile Cemetery&quot;.</p>
<p>I liked it; the length of it, the rhythm of it. But I didn't like the idea of actually using the word &quot;gentile&quot;. That word seemed too attached to a certain Jewish outlook and sensibility that Lenny Bruce had but I don't.</p>
<p>To be honest, the first time I heard this bit was probably the first time I'd ever heard the word &quot;gentile&quot; and my first impression was that it must be something like &quot;genteel&quot; or &quot;gentle&quot;. So it struck me thinking back that mishearing the word in this way might work. I didn't like &quot;The Genteel Cemetery&quot; so I went with &quot;The Gentle Cemetery&quot;. It kind of made me smile that someone might mishear it this way. Which made it almost like a pun.</p>
<p>There's also another reason that it stuck. One of the things I want to do with this site is explore what comedy is and how it works. I guess I felt it would be nice if the name embodied something like that, which I think Gentle Cemetery does.</p>
<p>The theory I am interested in is <a href="/x/benign-violation-theory/">Benign Violation Theory</a> which for me is about the juxtaposition of feelings of danger with feelings of safety. So in that way the word <em>gentle</em> represents the safety (ie. something benign) and the word <em>cemetery</em> represents danger (ie. the violation bit).</p>
<p>Whilst not exactly a joke, it did seem to fit.</p>
<p>Also comedy seems to be awash with the imagery of death and killing etc and a cemetery has all those connotations, so there's that...</p>
<p>Now, you could say, &quot;That's clearly a lot of post-hoc rationalisation,&quot; and you'd be right. But if there's one thing you need to know about me it's that I'm a big fan of post-hoc rationalisation.</p>
